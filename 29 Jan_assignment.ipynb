    "(Q1)Python was created by Guido van Rossum in 1989 and first released in 1991. Guido van Rossum was a researcher at the National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in the Netherlands, and Python was developed as a hobby project during his Christmas vacation. Van Rossum named the language after the Monty Python comedy troupe, and the design philosophy emphasizes code readability, simplicity, and ease of use."

    "\n",
    "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) - Python provides features like classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism that support object-oriented programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functional Programming - Python has features like first-class functions, closures, and higher-order functions that support functional programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Procedural Programming - Python can be used as a procedural programming language, with support for statements, functions, and modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scripting - Python is often used as a scripting language, which means that it can be used to automate repetitive tasks and to glue together other tools and systems.\n",

    "(Q3)Yes, Python is case-sensitive when it comes to handling identifiers (i.e., variables, functions, class names, etc.). For example, the names myVariable, myvariable, and myVARIABLE are treated as three different names in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that you have to be careful about the capitalization of your names, and use the same capitalization consistently throughout your code. For example, if you define a variable myVariable, you need to use myVariable every time you refer to it, and not myvariable or MYVARIABLE.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's a good practice to follow naming conventions in Python, such as using lowercase letters and underscores for variable names, and using CamelCase for class names. This helps to keep your code organized and readable."

    "Large community and library support: Python has a large and active community of users and developers, which provides extensive support, including a wealth of libraries and modules that can be used to extend its functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Platform independent: Python can run on many different operating systems, including Windows, MacOS, and Linux, making it a good choice for cross-platform development.\n",
    "\n",
    "High-level language: Python is a high-level language, which means that it abstracts away many of the lower-level details of programming, making it easier to write code that is easy to understand and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic typing: Python supports dynamic typing, which means that the type of a variable can change at runtime. This can be useful for certain types of applications, as it provides greater flexibility.\n",

    "Good performance: Python is known for its ease of use and readability, but it is also capable of delivering good performance, especially when combined with low-level languages such as C or C++.\n",

    "(Q14)Python has a memory management system that automatically manages the allocation and deallocation of memory for you. You don't need to worry about freeing up memory yourself, as Python's garbage collector will handle this for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you create an object in Python, the memory manager will allocate the necessary memory to store that object. When the object is no longer being used, the garbage collector will automatically reclaim the memory used by that object. This helps to ensure that you don't accidentally run out of memory while your program is running.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the automatic memory management provided by the garbage collector, Python also provides some features that can help you to manage your memory usage more effectively. For example, you can use the del statement to explicitly remove an object, which will cause its memory to be reclaimed by the garbage collector. You can also use the gc module to control the behavior of the garbage collector and perform manual memory management if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, Python's memory management system makes it easy to use and reduces the risk of memory-related bugs in your code. However, it is still important to be mindful of your memory usage, especially when working with large datasets or running programs that need to be highly optimized for performance.\n",
