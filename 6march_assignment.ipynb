    "Inferential statistics: It involves making generalizations and drawing conclusions about a population based on a sample of data. For example, using hypothesis testing to determine if a new drug is effective for a specific population."

    "Levels of measurement refer to the types of data that can be collected, which have different properties and analysis requirements. The four levels of measurement are nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio.\n",
    "Nominal: It represents data that can be classified into categories without any order or ranking. For example, gender or eye color.\n",
    "Ordinal: It represents data that can be ranked or ordered, but the differences between values are not equal. For example, the ranks in a race or academic grades.\n",
    "Interval: It represents data that can be ranked, and the differences between values are equal, but there is no true zero point. For example, temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit.\n",
    "Ratio: It represents data that can be ranked, the differences between values are equal, and there is a true zero point. For example, height or weight."

    "Q6. Why is it important to understand the level of measurement when analyzing data? Provide an example to illustrate your answer.\n",
    "It is important to understand the level of measurement when analyzing data because it affects the types of statistical analysis that can be performed. For example, nominal data can only be analyzed using descriptive statistics, while interval or ratio data can be analyzed using both descriptive and inferential statistics. Suppose we are analyzing the effectiveness of a new weight loss program using data collected on the heights and weights of participants. If we mistakenly treat height as a ratio variable, we may calculate the mean height and use it as a denominator in calculating the mean weight. This would result in a biased estimate of the mean weight."
