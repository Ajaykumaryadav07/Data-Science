    "Q5. Measures of dispersion such as range, variance, and standard deviation are used to describe the spread of a dataset. Range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset. Variance is a measure of how spread out the values are from the mean, calculated by taking the average of the squared differences between each value and the mean. Standard deviation is the square root of the variance. These measures give an idea of how much the values in a dataset vary from the central tendency. For example, if we have two datasets with the same mean but different standard deviations, the one with the larger standard deviation would have more spread out values."
