    "Q1. Lasso Regression, short for Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator, is a regression technique that combines regularization and feature selection. It extends ordinary least squares regression by adding a penalty term that encourages sparsity in the coefficient estimates. Unlike ridge regression, which uses the L2 regularization term, lasso regression employs the L1 regularization term, resulting in some coefficients being exactly set to zero. This property makes lasso regression a useful technique for feature selection.\n",

    "Q2. The main advantage of using Lasso Regression in feature selection is its ability to automatically select relevant features and discard irrelevant ones. By adding the L1 regularization term, lasso regression encourages sparsity in the coefficient estimates. As a result, some coefficients are shrunk to zero, effectively performing feature selection. This allows you to identify and focus on the most important features while disregarding the less relevant ones. Lasso regression can handle high-dimensional datasets and has the potential to provide a more interpretable and parsimonious model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. The interpretation of coefficients in lasso regression is similar to ordinary least squares regression, with some differences due to the L1 regularization. The coefficients represent the expected change in the target variable associated with a one-unit increase in the corresponding predictor variable while holding other predictors constant. However, since lasso regression can set coefficients to exactly zero, the interpretation differs in that zero coefficients indicate that the corresponding feature has been excluded from the model and has no effect on the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. In lasso regression, the main tuning parameter is the regularization parameter (lambda, denoted as Î»). Lambda controls the strength of regularization applied to the model. A higher lambda value increases the amount of regularization, leading to more coefficients being shrunk to zero. The tuning parameter determines the trade-off between model simplicity (fewer variables) and predictive accuracy. In addition to lambda, some implementations of lasso regression may also have an option to specify the maximum number of iterations or convergence criteria for the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. Lasso regression can be used for non-linear regression problems by incorporating non-linear transformations of the predictor variables. By applying non-linear transformations, such as polynomial terms or basis functions, to the predictor variables, you can introduce non-linear relationships into the model. This allows lasso regression to capture non-linear patterns between the predictors and the target variable. However, it's important to note that lasso regression itself does not inherently model non-linear relationships. The non-linearity is achieved by transforming the input features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. The main difference between ridge regression and lasso regression lies in the type of regularization used. Ridge regression employs L2 regularization, which shrinks the coefficient estimates towards zero, but rarely sets them exactly to zero. On the other hand, lasso regression uses L1 regularization, which can shrink some coefficients to exactly zero, resulting in feature selection. This property of lasso regression makes it well-suited for situations where the number of predictors is large, and feature selection is desired.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. Yes, lasso regression can handle multicollinearity in the input features. In fact, lasso regression can perform implicit variable selection by automatically excluding highly correlated variables. Due to the L1 regularization term, lasso regression tends to select one variable from a group of highly correlated variables and set the coefficients of the remaining variables in that group to zero. This ability to handle multicollinearity is a notable advantage of lasso regression over ordinary least squares regression, where multicollinearity can cause instability and unreliable coefficient estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. The optimal value of the regularization parameter (lambda) in lasso regression is typically selected using cross-validation techniques. By dividing the dataset into multiple subsets or folds, you can train and evaluate the lasso regression model using different lambda values. The lambda value that produces"
