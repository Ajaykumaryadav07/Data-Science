    "Q1. A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and stored in a way that allows efficient retrieval, management, and manipulation of the data. It is designed to handle large volumes of information and provide mechanisms for storing, retrieving, modifying, and deleting data.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not only SQL) are two different types of database management systems that are used to store and manage data, but they differ in their data models and approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL Databases:\n",
    "SQL databases are based on a relational data model. They use tables to store data, where each table consists of rows and columns. SQL databases enforce a predefined schema, which means the structure of the data is defined beforehand, specifying the tables, columns, and their data types. SQL databases use SQL as the standard language for querying and manipulating the data. Examples of SQL databases include MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, and Microsoft SQL Server.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL Databases:\n",
    "NoSQL databases are designed to handle unstructured and semi-structured data. They provide a flexible schema, allowing the storage of data without a predefined structure. NoSQL databases use various data models such as key-value pairs, document-oriented, column-oriented, and graph databases. Each model is optimized for specific types of data and use cases. NoSQL databases are known for their ability to scale horizontally, handling large amounts of data across multiple servers. Some popular NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, and Neo4j.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, SQL databases are based on a rigid, predefined schema, use SQL for querying, and are suitable for structured data with complex relationships. NoSQL databases offer a more flexible schema, are scalable, and are suitable for handling unstructured or rapidly changing data. The choice between SQL and NoSQL databases depends on the specific requirements and characteristics of the data and the application that will be using the database."

    "Q2. DDL stands for Data Definition Language. It is a set of SQL statements used to define and manage the structure of a database. DDL statements are responsible for creating, altering, and deleting database objects such as tables, indexes, views, and schemas. Let's explore the four commonly used DDL statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. CREATE:\n",
    "The CREATE statement is used to create new database objects. For example, to create a table named \"Employees\" with columns such as \"ID,\" \"Name,\" and \"Salary,\" you would use the CREATE TABLE statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE Employees (\n",
    "    ID INT,\n",
    "    Name VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "    Salary DECIMAL(10,2)\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This statement creates a new table called \"Employees\" with three columns: \"ID\" (integer type), \"Name\" (variable-length string type with a maximum length of 50 characters), and \"Salary\" (a decimal number with 10 digits, 2 of which are after the decimal point).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. DROP:\n",
    "The DROP statement is used to delete database objects such as tables, views, or indexes. For example, to delete the \"Employees\" table created in the previous example, you would use the DROP TABLE statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "DROP TABLE Employees;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This statement removes the \"Employees\" table and all its associated data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. ALTER:\n",
    "The ALTER statement is used to modify the structure of an existing database object. It allows you to add, modify, or delete columns, constraints, or other properties of a table. For example, to add a new column \"Department\" to the \"Employees\" table, you would use the ALTER TABLE statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "ALTER TABLE Employees\n",
    "ADD Department VARCHAR(50);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This statement modifies the \"Employees\" table by adding a new column called \"Department\" of type VARCHAR(50).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. TRUNCATE:\n",
    "The TRUNCATE statement is used to remove all data from a table while keeping its structure intact. It is faster than deleting rows using the DELETE statement, especially when dealing with large tables. For example, to remove all data from the \"Employees\" table, you would use the TRUNCATE TABLE statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "TRUNCATE TABLE Employees;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This statement removes all rows from the \"Employees\" table, effectively emptying it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, CREATE is used to create new database objects, DROP is used to delete objects, ALTER is used to modify the structure of existing objects, and TRUNCATE is used to remove all data from a table while preserving its structure. These DDL statements are essential for defining and managing the structure of a database."

    "Q3. DML stands for Data Manipulation Language. It is a subset of SQL statements used to manipulate and retrieve data within a database. DML statements are responsible for performing operations such as inserting, updating, and deleting data. Let's explore the three commonly used DML statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. INSERT:\n",
    "The INSERT statement is used to add new records or rows into a table. It allows you to specify the values for each column or provide the values from another query. For example, to insert a new record into the \"Employees\" table mentioned earlier, you would use the INSERT INTO statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "INSERT INTO Employees (ID, Name, Salary, Department)\n",
    "VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 5000, 'Sales');\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This statement inserts a new row into the \"Employees\" table with the specified values for the columns \"ID,\" \"Name,\" \"Salary,\" and \"Department.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. UPDATE:\n",
    "The UPDATE statement is used to modify existing records in a table. It allows you to update specific columns or values based on certain conditions. For example, to update the salary of an employee with the ID 1, you would use the UPDATE statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "UPDATE Employees\n",
    "SET Salary = 5500\n",
    "WHERE ID = 1;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This statement updates the \"Salary\" column to 5500 for the employee with the ID 1 in the \"Employees\" table.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. DELETE:\n",
    "The DELETE statement is used to remove one or more records from a table based on specified conditions. For example, to delete an employee with the ID 1 from the \"Employees\" table, you would use the DELETE statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "DELETE FROM Employees\n",
    "WHERE ID = 1;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This statement removes the row from the \"Employees\" table where the \"ID\" column matches the value 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, INSERT is used to add new records into a table, UPDATE is used to modify existing records, and DELETE is used to remove records from a table. These DML statements are crucial for manipulating and managing data within a database."

    "Q4. DQL stands for Data Query Language. It is a subset of SQL statements used to retrieve data from a database. The most commonly used DQL statement is SELECT, which is used to retrieve specific columns or rows from one or more tables. Let's explore the SELECT statement with an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic syntax of the SELECT statement is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT column1, column2, ...\n",
    "FROM table_name\n",
    "WHERE condition;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example that demonstrates the usage of SELECT:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a table named \"Employees\" with columns: \"ID,\" \"Name,\" \"Salary,\" and \"Department.\" To retrieve all the records from the \"Employees\" table, you would use the SELECT statement as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM Employees;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This statement selects all columns (indicated by *) from the \"Employees\" table, retrieving all the records.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to retrieve specific columns, you can specify them instead of using *:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT ID, Name, Salary FROM Employees;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This statement selects only the \"ID,\" \"Name,\" and \"Salary\" columns from the \"Employees\" table.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also apply conditions to filter the data using the WHERE clause. For example, to retrieve employees with a salary greater than 5000, you would use the following statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM Employees\n",
    "WHERE Salary > 5000;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This statement retrieves all columns from the \"Employees\" table where the \"Salary\" is greater than 5000.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can further enhance the SELECT statement by using functions, aliases, joining multiple tables, sorting the results, and performing aggregate operations. However, the basic structure remains the same, with SELECT being the core keyword for retrieving data from a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, DQL's main component is the SELECT statement, which allows you to query and retrieve specific columns or rows from one or more tables based on specified conditions."

    "Primary Key:\n",
    "A primary key is a column or a combination of columns in a table that uniquely identifies each row in that table. It ensures the uniqueness and integrity of the data in the table. Here are some key points about primary keys:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Uniqueness: Each value in a primary key column must be unique, meaning no two rows in the table can have the same primary key value.\n",
    "2. Non-nullability: A primary key column cannot contain null values. Every row in the table must have a valid value for the primary key.\n",
    "3. Indexing: Primary keys are often indexed to optimize data retrieval and enforce fast data access.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a table named \"Customers\" with a primary key column \"CustomerID.\" Each row in the \"Customers\" table will have a unique value for the \"CustomerID\" column, which serves as the primary key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Foreign Key:\n",
    "A foreign key is a column or a combination of columns in a table that establishes a link or a relationship with the primary key of another table. It is used to maintain referential integrity between related tables in a relational database. Here are some key points about foreign keys:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Relationship: A foreign key establishes a relationship between two tables by referencing the primary key of another table.\n",
    "2. Referential Integrity: The foreign key ensures that values in the referencing table (child table) correspond to valid values in the referenced table (parent table).\n",
    "3. Cascading Actions: Foreign keys can be configured to perform cascading actions such as ON DELETE or ON UPDATE, which automatically modify or delete related records in the child table when changes occur in the parent table.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider two tables, \"Orders\" and \"Customers.\" The \"Orders\" table may have a foreign key column \"CustomerID,\" which references the primary key \"CustomerID\" in the \"Customers\" table. This establishes a relationship between the two tables, allowing orders to be associated with specific customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, a primary key uniquely identifies rows in a table, while a foreign key establishes relationships between tables by referencing the primary key of another table. Primary keys ensure uniqueness and integrity, while foreign keys maintain referential integrity between related tables."
