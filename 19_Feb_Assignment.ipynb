    "Q:1\n",
    "Flask is a lightweight and popular web framework written in Python. It provides a simple and flexible way to build web applications and APIs. Flask follows the \"micro\" framework philosophy, which means it focuses on simplicity and minimalism, allowing developers to have more control over the application's structure and components.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some advantages of using the Flask framework:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Simplicity: Flask has a simple and intuitive API that is easy to understand and get started with. It has a minimalistic design, which allows developers to have more control and flexibility in building their applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Lightweight: Flask is a lightweight framework with a small codebase and minimal dependencies. It does not enforce any specific project structure or libraries, giving developers the freedom to choose and integrate the tools they need.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Flexible and Extensible: Flask provides a modular design that allows developers to choose and integrate various extensions based on their project requirements. There is a wide range of Flask extensions available for handling tasks such as database integration, authentication, form handling, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Templating: Flask includes a powerful templating engine called Jinja2, which allows developers to build dynamic and reusable HTML templates. Templating in Flask helps separate the application's logic from the presentation layer, promoting clean and maintainable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Routing and URL Mapping: Flask provides a routing mechanism that allows developers to define URL patterns and map them to specific functions or views within the application. This makes it easy to handle different HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.) and create RESTful APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Built-in Development Server: Flask comes with a built-in development server, allowing developers to quickly test and debug their applications during the development process. The development server provides features like automatic reloading on code changes, making the development workflow efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Large Community and Active Ecosystem: Flask has a large and active community of developers who contribute to its ecosystem. This results in a wide range of resources, tutorials, and extensions available, making it easier for developers to find solutions and enhance their Flask applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Python Integration: As a Python framework, Flask seamlessly integrates with the Python ecosystem. Developers can leverage the vast number of libraries and tools available in Python to extend the functionality of their Flask applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, Flask's simplicity, flexibility, and lightweight nature make it a popular choice for building small to medium-sized web applications and APIs. It allows developers to quickly get started, maintain clean code, and customize the application according to their specific needs."

    "Q2. Here's a simple Flask application that displays \"Hello World!!\" when accessed:\n",

    "```python\n",
    "from flask import Flask\n",
    "\n",
    "app = Flask(__name__)\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To run this Flask application, save the code in a Python file (e.g., `app.py`) and execute it. You will see the Flask development server start, and you can access the application by navigating to `http://localhost:5000` in your web browser.\n",
    "Q3. App routing in Flask refers to the process of mapping URLs to functions or views in a Flask application. It allows you to define different routes and their corresponding handlers, enabling your application to respond to specific URLs with the appropriate content or actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "App routes are used to define the URL patterns and the associated functions that handle those URLs. With app routing, you can specify the route URL, HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.), and define the corresponding function to be executed when that URL is accessed.\n",
    "\n",
    "App routes are used to create different endpoints in your Flask application, each serving a specific purpose or content. They provide a structured way to organize and handle the different parts of your application, making it easier to manage and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Here's a modified version of the Flask application that includes the `/welcome` and `/` routes to display the requested information:\n",

    "app = Flask(__name__)\n",

    "\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "    app.run()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run this Flask application and access the respective URLs (`http://localhost:5000/` and `http://localhost:5000/welcome`), you will see the following output:\n",
    "\n",
    "**For `/` route:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Company Name: ABC Corporation\n",
    "Location: India\n",

    "\n",
    "Q5. In Flask, the `url_for()` function is used for URL building. It generates the URL for a given endpoint function by taking into account the routing information defined in the Flask application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example code to demonstrate the working of the `url_for()` function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from flask import Flask, url_for\n",
    "\n",
    "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/')\n",
    "def hello():\n",
    "    return 'Hello'\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/user/<username>')\n",
    "def profile(username):\n",
    "    return f'Profile: {username}'\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "    with app.test_request_context():\n",
    "        print(url_for('hello'))  # Output: /\n",
    "        print(url_for('profile', username='john'))  # Output: /user/john\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `url_for()` function is used to generate the URLs for the `hello` and `profile` endpoints. The output shows the generated URLs for the respective endpoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run this code, it will print the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "/\n",
    "/user/john\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `url_for()` function is helpful when you want to generate URLs dynamically, based on the endpoint names and their associated routes defined in"
