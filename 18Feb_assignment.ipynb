    "Q1. What is an API? Give an example, where an API is used in real life.\n",
    "\n",
    "An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of protocols, routines, and tools for building software applications. It defines how different software components should interact and communicate with each other. APIs allow software developers to use pre-built functionalities to create new applications or integrate existing ones into their own projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of where an API is used in real life is in the integration of Google Maps into various websites and mobile applications. Google Maps provides an API that allows developers to access its mapping and location-based services, such as displaying maps, calculating routes, and geocoding addresses. This API integration enables developers to enhance their applications with these features without having to develop them from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Give advantages and disadvantages of using API.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of using API include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Time-saving: APIs allow developers to reuse pre-built functionalities, saving them time and effort.\n",
    "Cost-effective: Building an application from scratch can be expensive, but APIs enable developers to use existing tools and resources, reducing the cost of development.\n",
    "Scalability: APIs make it easier to scale applications, as they allow developers to add new features and functionalities without having to rebuild the entire application.\n",
    "Collaboration: APIs facilitate collaboration between different teams and organizations by allowing them to share data and resources.\n",
    "Disadvantages of using API include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Dependency: Applications that rely heavily on APIs may be affected by changes to the API or the service provider, causing disruptions in the application's functionality.\n",
    "Security risks: APIs may expose sensitive data to third-party applications if not properly secured.\n",
    "Lack of control: Developers may have limited control over the functionality and performance of the API, which may affect the overall user experience.\n",
    "Q3. What is a Web API? Differentiate between API and Web API.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Web API is a type of API that is accessed using the HTTP protocol over the internet. It provides a set of web-based endpoints that can be used to perform specific tasks or access data.\n",
    "\n",
    "API is a general term that encompasses different types of interfaces used for software development, including Web APIs. APIs may also be accessed through other means, such as libraries or software development kits (SDKs), which may not necessarily involve web-based protocols.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Explain REST and SOAP Architecture. Mention shortcomings of SOAP.\n",
    "\n",
    "REST (Representational State Transfer) and SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) are two architectural styles used for building web services.\n",
    "\n",
    "REST is an architectural style that uses HTTP methods, such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources. RESTful web services use resource-based URLs and rely on the HTTP protocol for communication. RESTful web services are lightweight and easy to scale, making them popular for building web and mobile applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "SOAP, on the other hand, is a protocol for exchanging structured data between web services. It uses XML (Extensible Markup Language) as the message format and can be transported over a variety of protocols, including HTTP, SMTP, and TCP. SOAP web services rely heavily on XML for data encoding, making them more complex than RESTful web services.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main shortcomings of SOAP is its complexity. The XML-based message format used by SOAP can be difficult to parse and can add overhead to communication between services. Additionally, SOAP web services can be more difficult to scale due to their reliance on XML and the overhead associated with the protocol.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. Differentiate between REST and SOAP.\n",
    "\n",
    "REST and SOAP are two different architectural styles used for building web services. The main differences between REST and SOAP are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Protocol: REST uses HTTP protocols such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to perform CRUD operations on resources, while SOAP uses XML"
