    "Q1: The t-test and z-test are both statistical tests used to determine if the means of two populations are significantly different. However, the t-test is used when the sample size is small or the population standard deviation is unknown, while the z-test is used when the sample size is large and the population standard deviation is known.\n",

    "For example, suppose we want to determine if there is a significant difference in the mean weight of apples harvested from two orchards.

    "Q5: A confidence interval is a range of values that provides an estimate of the true population parameter with a certain level of confidence. It is typically used in inferential statistics to indicate the precision of the estimated population parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate a confidence interval, you need to know the sample mean, sample size, population standard deviation (or sample standard deviation if the sample size is large), and the desired level of confidence. For example, a 95% confidence interval for a sample mean can be calculated using the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "Confidence interval = sample mean ± z*(standard error)\n",
    "\n",
    "where z is the critical value from the standard normal distribution corresponding to the desired level of confidence, and the standard error is the standard deviation of the sample mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, suppose a sample of 100 people was taken and their average age was 30 years old, with a standard deviation of 5 years. If we want to find a 95% confidence interval, the z-score corresponding to a 95% confidence level is 1.96. The standard error is calculated by dividing the population standard deviation by the square root of the sample size: 5/sqrt(100) = 0.5. Therefore, the 95% confidence interval for the true population mean age is:\n",
    "\n",
    "30 ± 1.96*(0.5) = [29, 31]\n",

If a car is selected at random and found to have a defective part, what is the probability that it is a type A car?\n",

    "Q8. The margin of error in a confidence interval is the range of values above and below the sample estimate that is likely to contain the true population parameter with a certain level of confidence. In other words, it is the amount of uncertainty associated with a sample estimate due to sampling variability. The margin of error is calculated as the product of the critical value for the desired level of confidence and the standard error of the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sample size affects the margin of error in two ways. First, as the sample size increases, the standard error decreases, which results in a smaller margin of error. Second, as the sample size increases, the critical value decreases, which also results in a smaller margin of error. Therefore, a larger sample size generally leads to a smaller margin of error.\n",

    "For example, a pollster wants to estimate the proportion of voters who support a particular candidate in an upcoming election. A random sample of 1000 voters is taken and 600 of them indicate support for the candidate. The pollster wants to calculate a 95% confidence interval for the true proportion of voters who support the candidate. The margin of error can be calculated as follows:\n",

    "Margin of error = critical value x standard error\n",
    "Critical value for 95% confidence level = 1.96 (from the standard normal distribution)\n",
